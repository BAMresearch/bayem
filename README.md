# Bayesian Inference
Collection of algorithms and helper classes to efficiently solve inference problems with both variational Bayesian and sampling methods.

The derivation of the currently implemented variational method can be found [here](https://bayesianinference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). After `$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, you can also build the website locally via `$ doit` and open `.build/index.html`.
